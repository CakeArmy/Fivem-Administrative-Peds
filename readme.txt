Hello FiveM members! Today I bring to you an Admin, Moderator, and Owner PED for ingame.

This is based off of https://forum.fivem.net/t/release-new-admin-mod-ped/64060 without the rules that he is trying to impose.
(I do have permission to reupload this)

The peds are attached to rarely used models 
(Trafifc Warden (IG) for owner) and (Dock Worker) (the second one) for the moderator and admin ped.


To get the vest on the admin/moderator ped just randomize your skin textures.
